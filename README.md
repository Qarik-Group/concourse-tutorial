## Thanks

Thanks to Alex Suraci for inventing Concourse CI, and to Pivotal for sponsoring him and a team of developers to work on it for over a year (2014 onwards).

At Stark & Wayne we started this tutorial as we were learning Concourse in early 2015, and we've been using Concourse in production since mid-2015 internally and at nearly all client projects.

Thanks to everyone who has worked through this tutorial and found it useful. I love learning that you're enjoying the tutorial and enjoying Concourse.

Thanks for all the pull requests to help fix regressions with some Concourse versions that came out with "backwards incompatible change".

## Getting started

Install Vagrant/Virtualbox.

Fetch this tutorial and start a local Concourse server:

```
git clone https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial.git
cd concourse-tutorial
vagrant box add concourse/lite --box-version $(cat VERSION)
vagrant up
```

Open http://192.168.100.4:8080/ in your browser:

[![initial](no_pipelines.png)](http://192.168.100.4:8080/)

Once the page loads in your browser, click to download the `fly` CLI appropriate for your operating system:

![cli](fly_cli.png)

Once downloaded, copy the `fly` binary into your path (`$PATH`), such as `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`. Don't forget to also make it executable. For example,

```
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo mv ~/Downloads/fly /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/fly
```

Target Concourse
----------------

In the spirit of declaring absolutely everything you do to get absolutely the same result every time, the `fly` CLI requires that you specify the target API for every `fly` request.

First, alias it with a name `tutorial` (this name is used by all the tutorial task scripts):

```
fly --target tutorial login --concourse-url http://192.168.100.4:8080
fly --target tutorial sync
```

You can now see this saved target Concourse API in a local file:

```
cat ~/.flyrc
```

Shows a simple YAML file with the API, credentials etc:

```yaml
targets:
  tutorial:
    api: http://192.168.100.4:8080
    token:
      type: ""
      value: ""
```

When we use the `fly` command we will target this Concourse API using `fly --target tutorial`.

> @alexsuraci: I promise you'll end up liking it more than having an implicit target state :) Makes reusing commands from shell history much less dangerous (rogue fly configure can be bad)

Tutorials
---------

### 01 - Hello World task

The central concept of Concourse is to run tasks. You can run them directly from the command line as below, or from within pipeline jobs (as per every other section of the tutorial).

```
cd 01_task_hello_world
fly --target tutorial execute --config task_hello_world.yml
```

The output starts with

```
executing build 1
initializing
```

Every task in Concourse runs within a "container" (as best available on the target platform). The `task_hello_world.yml` configuration shows that we are running on a `linux` platform using the `busybox` container image.

Within this container it will run the command `echo hello world`:

```yaml
---
platform: linux

image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source: {repository: busybox}

run:
  path: echo
  args: [hello world]
```

At this point in the output above it is downloading a Docker image `busybox`. It will only need to do this once; though will recheck every time that it has the latest `busybox` image.

Eventually it will continue and invoke the command `echo hello world` successfully:

```
running echo hello world
hello world
succeeded
```

Try changing the `image_resource:` and the `run:` and run a different task:

```yaml
---
platform: linux

image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source: {repository: ubuntu, tag: "14.04"}

run:
  path: uname
  args: [-a]
```

This task file is provided for convenience:

```
fly --target tutorial execute --config task_ubuntu_uname.yml
```

The output looks like:

```
executing build 2
initializing
running uname -a
Linux 96f1e0d6-ffdb-40e1-5e8b-5ae9a3b36a58 4.2.0-42-generic #49~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 29 20:22:11 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
succeeded
```

The reason that you can select any base `image` (or `image_resource` when [configuring a task](http://concourse.ci/running-tasks.html)) is that this allows your task to have any prepared dependencies that it needs to run. Instead of installing dependencies each time during a task you might choose to pre-bake them into an `image` to make your tasks much faster.

### 02 - Task inputs

In the previous section the only inputs to the task container were the `image` used. Base images, such as Docker images, are relatively static and relatively big, slow things to create. So Concourse supports `inputs` into tasks to pass in files/folders for processing.

Consider the working directory of a task that explicitly has no inputs:

```
cd ../02_task_inputs
fly --target tutorial execute --config no_inputs.yml
```

The task runs `ls -al` to show the (empty) contents of the working folder inside the container:

```
running ls -al
total 8
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Feb 27 07:23 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Feb 27 07:23 ..
```

In the example task `inputs_required.yml` we add a single input:

```yaml
inputs:
- name: some-important-input
```

When we try to execute the task:

```
fly --target tutorial execute --config inputs_required.yml
```

It will fail:

```
error: missing required input `some-important-input`
```

Commonly if wanting to run `fly execute` we will want to pass in the local folder (`.`). Use `-i name=path` option to configure each of the required `inputs`:

```
fly --target tutorial execute --config inputs_required.yml --input some-important-input=.
```

Now the `fly execute` command will upload the `.` directory as an input to the container. It will be made available at the path `some-important-input`:

```
running ls -alR
.:
total 8
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Feb 27 07:27 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Feb 27 07:27 ..
drwxr-xr-x    1 501      20              64 Feb 27 07:27 some-important-input

./some-important-input:
total 12
drwxr-xr-x    1 501      20              64 Feb 27 07:27 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root          4096 Feb 27 07:27 ..
-rw-r--r--    1 501      20             112 Feb 27 07:30 input_parent_dir.yml
-rw-r--r--    1 501      20             118 Feb 27 07:27 inputs_required.yml
-rw-r--r--    1 501      20              79 Feb 27 07:18 no_inputs.yml
```

To pass in a different directory as an input, provide its absolute or relative path:

```
fly --target tutorial execute --config inputs_required.yml --input some-important-input=../01_task_hello_world
```

The `fly execute --input ` option can be removed if the current directory is the same name as the required input.

The task `input_parent_dir.yml` contains an input `02_task_inputs` which is also the current directory. So the following command will work and return the same results as above:

```
fly --target tutorial execute --config input_parent_dir.yml
```

### 03 - Task scripts

The `inputs` feature of a task allows us to pass in two types of inputs:

* requirements/dependencies to be processed/tested/compiled
* task scripts to be executed to perform complex behavior

A common pattern is for Concourse tasks to `run:` complex shell scripts rather than directly invoking commands as we did above (we ran `uname` command with arguments `-a`).

Let's refactor `01_task_hello_world/task_ubuntu_uname.yml` into a new task `03_task_scripts/task_show_uname.yml` with a separated task script `03_task_scripts/task_show_uname.sh`

```
cd ../03_task_scripts
fly --target tutorial execute --config task_show_uname.yml
```

The former specifies the latter as its task script:

```yaml
run:
  path: ./03_task_scripts/task_show_uname.sh
```

_Where does the `./03_task_scripts/task_show_uname.sh` file come from?_

From section 2 we learned that we could pass `inputs` into the task. The task configuration `03_task_scripts/task_show_uname.yml` specifies one input:

```
inputs:
- name: 03_task_scripts
```

Since input `03_task_scripts` matches the current directory `03_task_scripts` we did not need to specify `fly execute --input 03_task_scripts=.`.

The current directory was uploaded to the Concourse task container and placed inside the `03_task_scripts` directory.

Therefore its file `task_show_uname.sh` is available within the Concourse task container at `03_task_scripts/task_show_uname.sh`.

The only further requirement is that `task_show_uname.sh` is an executable script.

### 04 - Basic pipeline

1% of tasks that Concourse runs are via `fly execute`. 99% of tasks that Concourse runs are within "pipelines".

```
cd ../04_basic_pipeline
fly --target tutorial set-pipeline --config pipeline.yml --pipeline helloworld
```

It will display the concourse pipeline (or any changes) and request confirmation:

```yaml
jobs:
  job job-hello-world has been added:
    name: job-hello-world
    public: true
    plan:
    - task: hello-world
      config:
        platform: linux
        image_resource:
          type: docker-image
          source: {repository: busybox}
        run:
          path: echo
          args:
          - hello world
          dir: ""
```

You will be prompted to apply any configuration changes each time you run `fly set-pipeline` (or its alias `fly sp`)

```
apply configuration? [yN]:
```

Press `y`.

You should see:

```
pipeline created!
you can view your pipeline here: http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/helloworld

the pipeline is currently paused. to unpause, either:
  - run the unpause-pipeline command
  - click play next to the pipeline in the web ui
```

As suggested, un-pause a pipeline from the `fly` CLI:

```
fly --target tutorial unpause-pipeline --pipeline helloworld
```

Next, as suggested, visit the web UI http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/helloworld.

Your first pipeline is unimpressive - a single job `job-hello-world` with no inputs from the left and no outputs to its right, no jobs feeding into it, nor jobs feeding from it. It is the most basic pipeline. The job is gray colour because it has never been run before.

Click on `job-hello-world` and then click on the large `+` in the top right corner. Your job will run.

![job](http://cl.ly/image/3i2e0k0v3O2l/02-job-hello-world.gif)

Clicking the top-left "Home" icon will show the status of our pipeline. The job `job-hello-world` is now green. This means that the last time the job ran it completed successfully.

### 05 - Tasks extracted into Resources

It is very fast to iterate on a job's tasks by configuring them in the `pipeline.yml` as above. You edit the `pipeline.yml`, run `fly set-pipeline`, and the entire pipeline is updated atomically.

But, as per section 3, if a task becomes complex then its `run:` command can be extracted into a task script, and the task itself can be extracted into a `yml` task file.

In section 3 we uploaded the task file and task script from our local computer with the `fly execute` command.

Unlike section 3, with a pipeline we now need to store the task file and task script somewhere outside of Concourse.

Concourse offers no services for storing/retrieving your data. No git repositories. No blobstores. No build numbers. Every input and output must be provided externally. Concourse calls them "Resources". Example resources are `git`, `s3` and `semver` respectively.

See the section "Available concourse resources" below for the list of available built-in resources and how to find community resources. Send messages to Slack. Bump a version number from 0.5.6 to 1.0.0. Create a ticket on Pivotal Tracker. It is all possible with Concourse resources.

The most common resource to store our task files and task scripts is the `git` resource.

This tutorial's source repository is a Git repo, and it contains many task files (and their task scripts). For example, the original `01_task_hello_world/task_hello_world.yml`.

The following pipeline will load this task file and run it. We will update the previous `helloworld` pipeline:

```
cd ../05_pipeline_task_hello_world
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline helloworld
```

The output will show the delta between the two pipelines and request confirmation. Type `y`. If successful, it will show:

```
apply configuration? [yN]: y
configuration updated
```

The [`helloworld` pipeline](http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/helloworld) now shows an input resource `resource-tutorial` feeding into the job `job-hello-world`.

![pipeline-task-hello-world](http://cl.ly/image/271z3T322l25/03-resource-job.gif)

This tutorial verbosely prefixes `resource-` to resource names, and `job-` to job names, to help you identify one versus the other whilst learning. Eventually you will know one from the other and can remove the extraneous text.

After manually triggering the job via the UI, the output will look like:

![job-task-from-task](http://cl.ly/image/0Q3m223v2l3M/job-task-from-task.png)

The in-progress or newly-completed `job-hello-world` job UI has three sections:

* Preparation for running the job - collecting inputs and dependencies
* `resource-tutorial` resource is fetched
* `hello-world` task is executed

The latter two are "steps" in the job's [build plan](http://concourse.ci/build-plans.html). A build plan is a sequence of steps to execute. These steps may fetch down or update Resources, or execute Tasks.

The first build plan step fetches down (note the down arrow to the left) a `git` repository for these training materials and tutorials. The pipeline named this resource `resource-tutorial`.

The `pipeline.yml` documents this single resource:

```yaml
resources:
- name: resource-tutorial
  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial.git
```

The resource name `resource-tutorial` is then used in the build plan for the job:

```yaml
jobs:
- name: job-hello-world
  public: true
  plan:
  - get: resource-tutorial
```

Any fetched resource can now be an input to any task in the job build plan. As discussed in section 3 & section 4, task inputs can be used as task scripts.

The second step runs a user-defined task. The pipeline named the task `hello-world`. The task itself is not described in the pipeline. Instead it is described in a file `01_task_hello_world/task_hello_world.yml` from the `resource-tutorial` input.

The completed job looks like:

```yaml
jobs:
- name: job-hello-world
  public: true
  plan:
  - get: resource-tutorial
  - task: hello-world
    file: resource-tutorial/01_task_hello_world/task_hello_world.yml
```

The task `{task: hello-world, file: resource-tutorial/...}` has access to all fetched resources (and later, to the outputs from tasks).

The name of resources, and later the name of task outputs, determines the name used to access them by other tasks (and later, by updated resources).

So, `hello-world` can access anything from `resource-tutorial` (this tutorial's `git` repository) under the `resource-tutorial/` path. Since the relative path of `task_hello_world.yml` task file inside this repo is `01_task_hello_world/task_hello_world.yml`, the `task: hello-world` references it by joining the two: `file: resource-tutorial/01_task_hello_world/task_hello_world.yml`


There are benefits and downsides to abstracting tasks into YAML files outside of the pipeline.

One benefit is that the behavior of the task can be kept in sync with the primary input resource (for example, a software project with tasks for running tests, building binaries, etc).

Another benefit of extracting inline tasks into task files is that `pipeline.yml` files can get long and it can be hard to read and comprehend all the YAML. When extracting tasks into separate files we can give them long names so that readers can understand the purpose and expectation of the tasks at a glance.

One downside is that the `pipeline.yml` no longer explains exactly what commands will be invoked. Comprehension of pipeline behavior is potentially reduced.

Also, when we extract inline tasks into files, `fly set-pipeline` is no longer the only step to updating a pipeline.

From now onwards, any change to your pipeline might require you to do one or both:

* `fly set-pipeline` to update Concourse on a change to the job build plan and/or input/output resources
* `git commit` and `git push` your primary resource that contains the task files and task scripts

If the new behavior you intended is not showing up in the pipeline then you may have skipped one of the two steps above.

### 06 - View job output in terminal

The `job-hello-world` had terminal output from its resource fetch of a git repo and of the `hello-world` task running.

In addition to the Concourse web ui you can also view this output from the terminal with `fly`:

```
fly --target tutorial watch --job helloworld/job-hello-world
```

The output will be similar to:

```
using version of resource found in cache
initializing
running echo hello world
hello world
succeeded
```

The `--build NUM` option allows you to see the output of a specific build number, rather than the latest build output.


You can see the results of recent builds across all pipelines with `fly builds`:

```
fly --target tutorial builds
```

The output will look like:

```
id  pipeline/job                build  status     start                     end                       duration

3   one-off                     n/a    succeeded  2017-01-09@10:40:40-0800  2017-01-09@10:40:43-0800  3s
2   one-off                     n/a    succeeded  2017-01-09@10:40:00-0800  2017-01-09@10:40:28-0800  28s
1   one-off                     n/a    succeeded  2017-01-09@10:39:41-0800  2017-01-09@10:39:51-0800  10s
```

### 07 - Trigger jobs with `fly`

There are three ways for a job to be triggered:

* Clicking the `+` button on the web UI of a job (as we did in previous sections)
* Input resource triggering a job (see section 8 below)
* `fly --target target trigger-job --job pipeline/jobname` command


```
fly --target tutorial trigger-job --job helloworld/job-hello-world
```

Whilst the job is running, and after it has completed, you can then watch the output in your terminal using `fly watch`:

```
fly --target tutorial watch --job helloworld/job-hello-world
```

### 08 - Triggering jobs with resources

The primary way that Concourse jobs will be triggered to run will be by resources changing. A `git` repo has a new commit? Run a job to test it. A GitHub project cuts a new release? Run a job to pull down its attached files and do something with them.

Triggering resources are defined the same as non-triggering resources, such as the `resource-tutorial` defined earlier.

The difference is in the job build plan where triggering is desired.

By default, including `get: my-resource` in a build plan does not trigger its job.

To mark a fetched resource as a trigger add `trigger: true`

```yaml
jobs:
- name: job-demo
  plan:
  - get: resource-tutorial
    trigger: true
```

In the above example the `job-demo` job would trigger anytime the remote `resource-tutorial` had a new version. For a `git` resource this would be new git commits.

The `time` resource has express purpose of triggering jobs.

If you want a job to trigger every few minutes then there is the [`time` resource](https://github.com/concourse/time-resource#readme).

```yaml
resources:
- name: my-timer
  type: time
  source:
    interval: 2m
```

Now upgrade the `helloworld` pipeline with the `time` trigger.

```
cd ../08_triggers
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline helloworld
```

This adds a new resource named `my-timer` which triggers `job-hello-world` approximately every 2 minutes.

Visit the pipeline dashboard http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/helloworld and wait a few minutes and eventually the job will start running automatically.

![my-timer](http://cl.ly/3M3A2n1e2i2s/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%2010.39.37%20am.png)

The dashboard UI makes non-triggering resources distinct with a hyphenated line connecting them into the job. Triggering resources have a full line.

Why does `time` resource configured with `interval: 2m` trigger "approximately" every 2 minutes?

> "resources are checked every minute, but there's a shorter (10sec) interval for determining when a build should run; time resource is to just ensure a build runs on some rough periodicity; we use it to e.g. continuously run integration/acceptance tests to weed out flakiness" - alex

The net result is that a timer of `2m` will trigger every 2 to 3 minutes.

### 09 - Destroying pipelines

The current `helloworld` pipeline will now keep triggering every 2-3 minutes for ever. If you want to destroy a pipeline - and lose all its build history - then may the power be granted to you.

You can delete the `helloworld` pipeline:

```
fly destroy-pipeline --target tutorial --pipeline helloworld
```

### 10 - Using resource inputs in job tasks

Note, the topic of running unit tests in your pipeline will be covered in more detail in future sections.

Consider a simple application that has unit tests. In order to run those tests inside a pipeline we need:

* a task `image` that contains any dependencies
* an input `resource` containing the task script that knows how to run the tests
* an input `resource` containing the application source code

For the example Go application [simple-go-web-app](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/simple-go-web-app), the task image needs to include the Go programming language. We will use the `golang:1.6-alpine` image from:

https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/ (see https://imagelayers.io/?images=golang:1.6-alpine for size of layers)

The task file `task_run_tests.yml` includes:

```yaml
image_resource:
  type: docker-image
  source: {repository: golang, tag: 1.6-alpine}

inputs:
- name: resource-tutorial
- name: resource-app
  path: gopath/src/github.com/cloudfoundry-community/simple-go-web-app
```

The `resource-app` resource will place the inbound files for the input into an alternate path. By default we have seen that inputs store their contents in a folder of the same name. The reason for using an alternate path in this example is specific to building & testing Go language applications and is outside the scope of the section.

To run this task within a pipeline:

```
cd ../10_job_inputs
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline simple-app --non-interactive
fly unpause-pipeline --target tutorial --pipeline simple-app
```

View the pipeline UI http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/simple-app and notice that the job automatically starts.

The job will pause on the first run at `web-app-tests` task because it is downloading the `golang:1.6-alpine` image for the first time.

The `web-app-tests` output below corresponds to the Go language test output (in case you've not seen it before):

```
ok  	github.com/cloudfoundry-community/simple-go-web-app	0.003s
```


### 11 - Passing task outputs to another task

In section 10 our task `web-app-tests` consumed an input resource and ran a script that ran some unit tests. The task did not create anything new. Some tasks will want to create something that is then passed to another task for further processing (this section); and some tasks will create something that is pushed back out to the external world (next section).

So far our pipelines' tasks' inputs have only come from resources using `get: resource-tutorial` build plan steps.

A task's `inputs` can also come from the `outputs` of previous tasks. All a task needs to do is declare that it publishes `outputs`, and subsequent steps can consume those as `inputs` by the same name.

A task file declares it will publish outputs with the `outputs` section:

```
outputs:
- name: some-files
```

If a task included the above `outputs` section then its `run:` command would be responsible for putting interesting files in the `some-files` directory.

Subsequent tasks (discussed in this section) or resources (discussed in the next section) could reference these interesting files within the `some-files/` directory.

```
cd ../11_task_outputs_to_inputs
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline pass-files --non-interactive
fly unpause-pipeline --target tutorial --pipeline pass-files
```

Open http://192.168.100.4:8080/teams/main/pipelines/pass-files in your browser and trigger `job-pass-files`.

In this pipeline's `job-pass-files` there are two task steps `create-some-files` and `show-some-files`:

![pass-files](http://cl.ly/1j32242g0227/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%205.14.12%20pm.png)

The former creates 4 files into its own `some-files/` directory. The latter gets a copy of these files placed in its own task container filesystem at the path `some-files/`.

The pipeline build plan only shows that two tasks are to be run in a specific order. It does not indicate that `show-files/` is an output of one task and used as an input into the next task.

```yaml
jobs:
- name: job-pass-files
  public: true
  plan:
  - get: resource-tutorial
  - task: create-some-files
    file: resource-tutorial/11_task_outputs_to_inputs/create_some_files.yml
  - task: show-some-files
    file: resource-tutorial/11_task_outputs_to_inputs/show_files.yml
```

Note, task `create-some-files` build output includes the following error:

```
mkdir: can't create directory 'some-files': File exists
```

This is a demonstration that if a task includes `outputs` then those output directories are pre-created and do not need creating.


### 12 - Publishing outputs

So far we have used the `git` resource to fetch down a git repository, and used `git` & `time` resources as triggers. The [`git` resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) can also be used to push a modified git repository to a remote endpoint (possibly different than where the git repo was originally cloned from).

```
cd ../12_publishing_outputs
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline publishing-outputs --non-interactive
fly unpause-pipeline --target tutorial --pipeline publishing-outputs
```

Pipeline dashboard http://192.168.100.4:8080/pipelines/publishing-outputs shows that the input resource is erroring (see orange in key):

![broken-resource](http://cl.ly/330n473y3X1s/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%206.33.26%20pm.png)

The `pipeline.yml` does not yet have a git repo nor its write-access private key credentials.

[Create a Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with a single file `bumpme`, and press "Create public gist":

![gist](http://cl.ly/3P1m1m272B2h/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%206.35.10%20pm.png)

Copy the "SSH" git URL:

![ssh](http://cl.ly/2m303j1r3E3b/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%206.36.52%20pm.png)

And paste it into the `pipeline.yml` file:

```
---
resources:
- name: resource-gist
  type: git
  source:
    uri: git@gist.github.com:0c2e172346cb8b0197a9.git
    branch: master
    private_key: |
      -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
      MIIEpQIBAAKCAQEAuvUl9YU...
      ...
      HBstYQubAQy4oAEHu8osRhH...
      -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Also paste in your `~/.ssh/id_rsa` private key (or which ever you have registered with github) into the `private_key` section.
Be careful, If you don't include the pipe symbol after `private_key: ` you will get an error like `Private keys with passphrases are not supported.`

Update the pipeline:

```
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline publishing-outputs --non-interactive
```

Revisit the dashboard UI and the orange resource will change to black if it can successfully fetch the new `git@gist.github.com:XXXX.git` repo.

After running the `job-bump-date` job, refresh your gist:

![bumped](http://cl.ly/2w0E3U0y0735/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%208.47.54%20pm.png)

This pipeline is an example of updating a resource. It has pushed up new git commits to the git repo (your github gist).

_Where did the new commit come from?_

The `bump-timestamp-file.yml` task file describes a single output `updated-gist`:

```yaml
outputs:
  - name: updated-gist
```

The `bump-timestamp-file` task runs the following `bump-timestamp-file.sh` script:

```bash
git clone resource-gist updated-gist

cd updated-gist
echo $(date) > bumpme

git config --global user.email "nobody@concourse.ci"
git config --global user.name "Concourse"

git add .
git commit -m "Bumped date"
```

First, it copied the input resource `resource-gist` into the output resource `updated-gist` (using `git clone` as the preferred `git` way to do this). The modifications are subsequently made to the `updated-gist` directory, including a `git commit`. It is this `updated-gist` and its additional `git commit` that is subsequently pushed back to the gist by the pipeline step:

```yaml
- put: resource-gist
  params: {repository: updated-gist}
```

The `updated-gist` output from the `bump-timestamp-file` task becomes the `updated-gist` input to the `resource-gist` resource (see the [`git` resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) for additional configuration) because their names match.

The `bump-timestamp-file.sh` script needed the `git` CLI tool. It could have installed it each time via `apt-get install git` or similar, but this would have made the task very slow. Instead `bump-timestamp-file.yml` task file uses a different base image `concourse/concourse-ci` that contains `git` CLI (and many other pre-installed packages). The contents of this Docker image are described at https://github.com/concourse/concourse/blob/master/ci/dockerfiles/bosh-cli/Dockerfile

### 13 - Actual pipeline - passing resources between jobs

Finally, it is time to make an actual pipeline - one job passing results to another job upon success.

In all previous sections our pipelines have only had a single job. For all their wonderfulness, they haven't yet felt like actual pipelines. Jobs passing results between jobs. This is where Concourse shines even brighter.

Update the `publishing-outputs` pipeline with a second job `job-show-date` which will run whenever the first job successfully completes:

```yaml
- name: job-show-date
  plan:
  - get: resource-tutorial
  - get: resource-gist
    passed: [job-bump-date]
    trigger: true
  - task: show-date
    config:
      platform: linux
      image_resource:
        type: docker-image
        source: {repository: busybox}
      inputs:
        - name: resource-gist
      run:
        path: cat
        args: [resource-gist/bumpme]
```

Update the pipeline:

```
cd ../13_pipeline_jobs
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline publishing-outputs --non-interactive
```

The dashboard UI displays the additional job and its trigger/non-trigger resources. Importantly, it shows our first pipeline:

![pipeline](http://cl.ly/3y0i0Z2v2b2F/download/Image%202016-02-28%20at%209.09.14%20pm.png)

The latest `resource-gist` commit fetched down in `job-show-date` will be the exact commit used in the last successful `job-bump-date` job. If you manually created a new git commit in your gist and manually ran the `job-show-date` job it would continue to use the previous commit it used, and ignore your new commit. *This is the power of pipelines.*

![trigger](http://cl.ly/3x1t0T450g1h/download/pipeline-flow.gif)

### 14 - Parameterized pipelines

In the preceding sections you were asked to private credentials and personal git URLs into the `pipeline.yml` files. This would make it difficult to share your `pipeline.yml` with anyone who had access to the repository. Not everyone needs nor should have access to the shared secrets.

Concourse pipelines can include `{{parameter}}` parameters for any value in the pipeline YAML file.

Parameters are all mandatory:

```
cd ../14_parameters
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline publishing-outputs --non-interactive
```

The error output will be like:

```
failed to evaluate variables into template: 2 error(s) occurred:

* unbound variable in template: 'gist-url'
* unbound variable in template: 'github-private-key'
```

Somewhere secret on laptop create a `credentials.yml` file with keys `gist-url` and `github-private-key`. The values come from your previous `pipeline.yml` files:

```
gist-url: git@gist.github.com:xxxxxxx.git
github-private-key: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIEpQIBAAKCAQEAuvUl9YUlDHWBMVcuu0FH9u2gSi83PkL4o9TS+F185qDTlfUY
  fGLxDo/bn8ws8B88oNbRKBZR6yig9anIB4Hym2mSwuMOUAg5qsA9zm5ArXQBGoAr
  ...
  iSHcGbKdWqpObR7oau2LIR6UtLvevUXNu80XNy+jaXltqo7MSSBYJjbnLTmdUFwp
  HBstYQubAQy4oAEHu8osRhH1VX8AR/atewdHHTm48DN74M/FX3/HeJo=
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

To pass in your `credentials.yml` file use the `--load-vars-from` or `-l` options:

```
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline publishing-outputs --non-interactive --load-vars-from ../credentials.yml
```

## Continuing the tutorial

This tutorial now leaves this README and goes out to the dozens of subfolders. Each has its own README.

Why are there numerical gaps between the section numbers? Because renumbering is hard and so I just left gaps. If we had a cool way to renumber the sections then perhaps wouldn't need the gaps. Sorry :)


### Available concourse resources

In addition to the `git` resource and the `time` resource there are many ways to interact with the external world: getting objects/data or putting objects/data.

Two ideas for finding them:

* https://github.com/concourse?query=resource - the resources bundled with every concourse installation
* https://github.com/search?q=concourse+resource - additional resources shared by other concourse users

Some of the bundled resources include:

-	[bosh-deployment-resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-deployment-resource) - deploy bosh releases as part of your pipeline
-	[semver-resource](https://github.com/concourse/semver-resource) - automated semantic version bumping
-	[bosh-io-release-resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-io-release-resource) - Tracks the versions of a release on bosh.io
-	[s3-resource](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource) - Concourse resource for interacting with AWS S3
-	[git-resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) - Tracks the commits in a git repository.
-	[bosh-io-stemcell-resource](https://github.com/concourse/bosh-io-stemcell-resource) - Tracks the versions of a stemcell on bosh.io.
-	[vagrant-cloud-resource](https://github.com/concourse/vagrant-cloud-resource) - manages boxes in vagrant cloud, by provider
-	[docker-image-resource](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource) - a resource for docker images
-	[archive-resource](https://github.com/concourse/archive-resource) - downloads and extracts an archive (currently tgz) from a uri
-	[github-release-resource](https://github.com/concourse/github-release-resource) - a resource for github releases
-	[tracker-resource](https://github.com/concourse/tracker-resource) - pivotal tracker output resource
-	[time-resource](https://github.com/concourse/time-resource) - a resource for triggering on an interval
-	[cf-resource](https://github.com/concourse/cf-resource) - Concourse resource for interacting with Cloud Foundry

To find out which resources are available on your target Concourse you can ask the API endpoint `/api/v1/workers`:

```
$ curl -s http://192.168.100.4:8080/api/v1/workers | jq -r ".[0].resource_types[].type" | sort
archive
bosh-deployment
bosh-io-release
bosh-io-stemcell
cf
docker-image
git
github-release
pool
s3
semver
time
tracker
vagrant-cloud
```
