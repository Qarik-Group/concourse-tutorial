# View job output in terminal

The `job-hello-world` had terminal output from its resource fetch of a git repo and of the `hello-world` task running.

In addition to the Concourse web ui you can also view this output from the terminal with `fly`:

```
fly -t tutorial watch -j helloworld/job-hello-world
```

The output will be similar to:

```
using version of resource found in cache
initializing
running echo hello world
hello world
succeeded
```

The `--build NUM` option allows you to see the output of a specific build number, rather than the latest build output.


You can see the results of recent builds across all pipelines with `fly builds`:

```
fly -t tutorial builds
```

The output will look like:

```
