description: Our first look at a 'hello world' Concourse pipeline.

# Basic Pipeline

1% of tasks that Concourse runs are via `fly execute`. 99% of tasks that Concourse runs are within "pipelines".

```
cd ../basic-pipeline
fly -t tutorial set-pipeline -c pipeline.yml -p hello-world
```

It will display the concourse pipeline (or any changes) and request confirmation:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: job-hello-world
    public: true
    plan:
      - task: hello-world
        config:
          platform: linux
          image_resource:
            type: docker-image
            source: {repository: busybox}
          run:
            path: echo
            args: [hello world]
```

You will be prompted to apply any configuration changes each time you run `fly set-pipeline` (or its alias `fly sp`)

```
apply configuration? [yN]:
```

Press `y`.

You should see:

```
pipeline created!
you can view your pipeline here: http://127.0.0.1:8080/teams/main/pipelines/hello-world

the pipeline is currently paused. to unpause, either:
  - run the unpause-pipeline command
  - click play next to the pipeline in the web ui
```

## Login to Concourse Web UI

Visit the pipeline URL http://127.0.0.1:8080/teams/main/pipelines/hello-world

It is a private pipeline and currently you are not logged in to the Concourse Web UI. You will be redirected to a login page.

Enter the credentials for the admin user defined in `docker-compose.yml` then click "login" and you'll be redirected back to your pipeline.

## Unpausing Pipelines

Your pipeline has a blue bar across the top. This means it is paused. New pipelines start paused as you might not yet be ready for triggers to fire and start jobs running.

There are two ways to unpause (or re-pause) a pipeline.

1. Click the propeller icon in the top left to be redirected back the concourse dashboard. Then click the play button on your pipeline.

2. Using the `fly unpause-pipeline` command (or its alias `fly up`):

    ```
    fly -t tutorial unpause-pipeline -p hello-world
    fly -t tutorial unpause-job --job hello-world/job-hello-world
    ```

## First Pipeline

This first pipeline is unimpressive - a single job `job-hello-world` with no inputs from the left and no outputs to its right, no jobs feeding into it, nor jobs feeding from it. It is the most basic pipeline. The job is gray colour because it has never been run before.

Click on `job-hello-world` and then click on the large `+` in the top right corner. Your job will run.

Clicking the top-left "Home" icon will show the status of our pipeline. The job `job-hello-world` is now green. This means that the last time the job ran it completed successfully.
