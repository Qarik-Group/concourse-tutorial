# Deploying applications to Cloud Foundry

Whilst Concourse could be used to push applications to any remote system for deployment, it is particularly easy to deploy to a Cloud Foundry with the built-in [`cf` resource](https://github.com/concourse/cf-resource).

*NOTE*: - See later section on using and writing custom resources if you are deploying to a different target environment/platform, such as Heroku.

Add the following key/values to your `credentials.yml` file:

```yaml
cf-api: https://api.yourcf.com
cf-username: your@email.com
cf-password: yourpassword
cf-organization: yourcompany
cf-space: concourse-tutorial
```

You can now create the pipeline and unpause it.

```
cd ../15_deploy_cloudfoundry_app
fly set-pipeline --target tutorial --config pipeline.yml --pipeline deploy-app --non-interactive --load-vars-from ../credentials.yml
fly unpause-pipeline --target tutorial --pipeline deploy-app
```

The `cf` resource assumes that the target organization and space already exist.

To use this resource in your own pipelines first define the resource with parameters for the secrets/credentials:

```yaml
- name: resource-deploy-web-app
  type: cf
  source:
    api: {{cf-api}}
    username: {{cf-username}}
    password: {{cf-password}}
    organization: {{cf-organization}}
    space: {{cf-space}}
    skip_cert_check: true
```

## `put` but no `get`

The `cf` resource is slightly different from many resources - it can only be used as a `put:` step to deploy an application; it has no `get:` use case to fetch an application/information/source or whatever else `get` might mean for a running web application.

*Why `put` but not `get`?*

See the `cf` resource github readme [under Behavior](https://github.com/concourse/cf-resource#behaviour). It describes an `out` (maps to `put:` steps) but does not describe an `in` (used by `get:`) nor `check` (used by `get:` with `trigger: true` enabled).

## Bonus exercise

In this example the `manifest.yml` was pre-defined in the application git resource. This might not be the `cf` manifest that works best for you.

Insert an additional task step before the `put: resource-deploy-web-app` step that outputs an alternate `manifest.yml`. Then change `manifest: resource-web-app/manifest.yml` to this alternate.

For example, if your new task declares an output `- name: cf-manifest` and places a `manifest.yml` into it, then the final `put:` step will be:

```yaml
- put: resource-deploy-web-app
  params:
    manifest: cf-manifest/manifest.yml
    path: resource-web-app
```
